This makes programming accessible to kids as they don\u00b4t have to worry about the syntax (i.e. they don\u00b4t need to learn how to write code in a literal programming language such as Processing, C++ or Java). Bitbloq uses this paradigm because it has been proven to be effective among children, and also because Scratch is already used in many schools and education centres. Our philosophy is that it\u00b4s better to join forces than to reinvent the wheel.
